## Overview 
RouteMe is an Javascript application that creates a clear cost and time comparison between driving and taking public transport for a given trip. 

- Global warming is a real issue. Wiser decisions between driving and public transport can reduce pollution.
- Gas budget. We drive everyday but seldom do we pay close attention to how much we are spending on gas. 
- Commute time. Bad traffic is a pain for everyone and the right mode of transit is the solution.
